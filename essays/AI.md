## Introduction
### AI the New Calculator

Some have compared the use of AI in education to the use of a calculator in a classroom. Before calculators people solved math problems either by hand or using devices, like an Abacus, Mechanical Slide Rule, and Napier's Bones. The processes of solving an equation during this time was undoubtedly more cumbersome then using a calculator. For example, a complex math expression can be solved in seconds today using a calculator, but would take minutes to hours without one. 

The benefits of using a calculator on a math problem then parallels using AI to tackle any sort of problem today. Whether you are using AI to solve a math problem or even just answer a simple question, it provides you with an answer in seconds. In software engineering AI can be especially useful. AI tools allow anyone write programs, understand existing ones, debug their code, and many other things. 

### AI in Education
    
The introduction of a new technology into society will always come with some resistance. In most of my classes the use of AI is either highly discouraged or not allowed. In these classes my teachers fear that that work their students turn in is not their own. However, in my ICS 314 class the perspective on AI is more positive. Students are `free to make use of AI to inspect code, write code, explain code, and more. 

## My Experience with AI

When my instructor notified my class that the use of AI was allowed and even encouraged in this course I was shocked, and excited. Below I describe by experience using AI (Chat GPT) in the course ICS 314 (Software Engineering I).

#### Experience WODs
Given experience WODs were only graded upon completion I did not find myself heavily relying on AI tools to complete them. Most of the time I would try to complete the WOD as best as I could  once (using AI if needed), reference the instructional video if needed, then try again. For some experiences, however, I did find AI to be very useful to write simple bulk code. 

#### In-class Practice WODs
I found AI to be most useful in practice WODs when trying to debug my code. The goal of practice WODs is to help prepare students for their in-class WODs, so I tried to take these as seriously as possible. That said for these experiences I would attempt to do the WOD on my own, without help, and use AI for debugging purposes. To debug my code, I would ask Chat GPT to fix any logical errors in the section of code I specified. 

#### In-class WODs
In-class WODs are the most stressful part of this course as students must complete a certain tasks in a limited amount of time. Due to all the stress
