## Why Have Coding Standards?

Have you ever looked over a colleague's or a peer's code and been completely disoriented because their work was not organized like yours? This is why having and following coding standards is important. Coding Standards provide us with guidelines and techniques to write code, making it more efficient and readable. So when you look over someone else's, or even your own work, you feel confident in what you're reading.

## Working with Coding Standards in IntelliJ
Before I was introduced to software development I did not consistently apply coding standards to all my projects. One could say that I only followed certain coding guidelines if I knew my grade depended on it. While I am sometimes lazy with my code, I do appreciate consistency, correctness, and readability.

In the software development course I am taking (ICS 314) we are using ESLint with the IntelliJ IDE to implement syntactic coding standards in our projects. So far, I am very appreciative of the services this tool provides. Specifically, the tool identifies syntax or structural problems that would otherwise disable my code from working. This enables me to code more efficiently and in less time because I don't have to try to locate syntax mistakes in my code. In other words, ESLint eliminates all the syntactic errors so I can focus on semantic ones. Another aspect of implementing coding standards into my programs I enjoy is that all my code looks similar. This makes it easier to read and compare my programs.
