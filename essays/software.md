## New Beginnings 
I began my programming career in the Fall of 2020 with ICS 111 (Java). Learning how to write code proved very cumbersome for me initially. I would constantly get lost in the details of my first coding assignments and I would lose track of the big picture. Some "easy" assignments would take me hours to complete. However, with practice, I learned to implement a top-down approach to my coding assignments. This approach to solving problems tremendously helped me in my following ICS classes (ICS 211 (Java), and ICS 212 (C, C++)). 

## Finding My Place In Computer Science
My decision to double major in astrophysics and computer science was far from unintentional. In physics and astronomy knowing how to deal with large data sets and solve physical problems with computers is essential. Early on in my astronomy courses, we had to get comfortable with programming in Python. We would use environments like google colab and jupyter notebook to analyze and visualize astronomical data. I soon found that even my astronomy courses were teaching me how to write efficient code and how to use libraries and tools. I think that not only has my knowledge from my ICS courses helped me in astronomy but the opposite is true too. 

## Broadening my Skill Set
One may wonder why would an aspiring astrophysicist take up software engineering. The best answer I have is that learning something new and acquiring a new set of skills never hurts! I truly think that opening yourself up to new fields can help your performance in your own field tremendously. For example, one may learn new ways of thinking about problems and how to tackle them from different angles. I know that having experience in computer science has helped me resolve many computational issues I had in my astronomy courses. I am excited to start my journey into software engineering for all the new things I will learn.
