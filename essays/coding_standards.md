## Why Have Coding Standards?

Have you ever looked over a colleague's or a peer's code and been completely disoriented because their work was not organized like yours? This is why having and following coding standards is important. Coding Standards provide us with guidelines and techniques to write code, making it more readable and efficient. So when you look over someone else's, or even your own, work you feel confident in what you're reading.

## Working with Coding Standards in IntelliJ

Before I was introduced to software engineering I did not consistently apply coding standards to all my projects. One could say that I only followed certain coding guidelines if I knew my grade depended on it. Otherwise, I wouldn't care what my code looked like, just if it worked. While I am sometimes lazy with my code, I do appreciate consistency, correctness, and readability.

In the software engineering course I am taking (ICS 314) we are using ESLint with the IntelliJ IDE to implement syntactic coding standards in our projects. So far, I am very appreciative of the services this tool provides. Specifically, the tool identifies syntax or structural problems that would otherwise disable my code from working. This enables me to code more efficiently and in less time because I don't have to try to locate syntax mistakes in my code. In other words, ESLint eliminates all the syntactic errors so I can focus on semantic ones.

However, while I do value the consistency ESLint gives my code, it can be a pest at times. Often when I write code I am not focused on its appearance, but ESLint is. For example, the tool will catch small things like if I missed a space after a curly bracket ("{"). This problem does not impact the correctness of my code, but it may make it more readable to someone else. As a young programmer, I tend to make syntactic errors like this quite often, so I tend to spend some time fixing small typos.

## Final Thoughts
Overall, I welcome the use of coding standards in programming, despite how exact and tedious they may be. Being able to write readable, consistent, and efficient code is essential to being a successful programmer. I also believe that following coding standards, specifically those ESLint imposes, will help me learn the JavaScript language better. Like when you're using any word processing feature to check the grammar or spelling of your writing, after a while you will start to remember the suggestions it gives you. Eventually you wont make the same mistakes and therefore will have learned something about the rules that govern the language. This is exactly what I have found to be true with using ESLint. It just takes practice!
