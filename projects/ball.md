summary: "I model the trajectory of a bouncing ball using the equations of motion, initial conditions, and
the ballâ€™s coefficient of restitution."

In a perfect world, a ball drops from some height and returns to its initial position after it bounces off 
the ground. The ball's energy is conserved. We live on Earth, however, and energy is not always conserved. A bouncing 
ball is a perfect example of this observation. The maximum height the ball can reach decreases as the number of 
bounce cycles increases, due to the decrease in energy after each bounce. We can model the trajectory of a bouncing ball 
by plotting the position of the ball over time. To find the positions we can use the equations of motion and the 
coefficient of restitution. We can also observe how the coefficient of restitution impacts the total distance the 
ball travels (after 10 bounce cycles) by comparing the distance traveled in $\it n$ bounces with different 
coefficients.
