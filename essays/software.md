## New Beginnings 
I began my programming career in the Fall of 2020 with ICS 111 (Java). Learning how to write code proved very cumbersome for me initially. I would constantly get lost in the details of my first coding assignments and I would lose track of the big picture. Some "easy" assignments would take me hours to complete. However, with practice, I learned to implement a top-down approach to my coding assignments. This approach to solving problems tremendously helped me in my following ICS classes (ICS 211 (Java), ICS 212 (C, C++)). 

## Finding My Place In Computer Science
My decision to double major in astrophysics and computer science was far from unintentional. In physics and astronomy knowing how to deal with large sets of data and solve physical problems with computers is essential.
