## Why Have Coding Standards?

Have you ever looked over a colleague's or a peer's code and been completely disoriented because their work was not organized like your own? This is why having and following coding standards is important. Coding Standards provides us with guidelines and techniques to write code, making it more efficient and readable. So when you look over someone else's or even your own you feel confident in what your reading. 

## Working with Coding Standards in IntelliJ
Before I was introduced to software I did not consistently apply coding standards into all my projects. One could say that I only followed certain coding guidelines if I knew my grade depended on it. While I am sometimes lazy with my code, I do appreciate consistency and readability. 

In the software development course I am taking we are using ESLint coding standards in the IntelliJ IDE.
