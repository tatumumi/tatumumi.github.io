summary: "I modeled the trajectory of a bouncing ball using the equations of motion, initial conditions, and
the ballâ€™s coefficient of restitution."

In a perfect world, a ball drops from some height and returns to its initial position after it bounces off 
the ground. The ball's energy is conserved. We live on Earth, however, and energy is not always conserved. A bouncing ball is a perfect example of this observation. The maximum height the ball can reach decreases as the number of bounce cycles increases, due to the decrease in energy after each bounce. We modeled the trajectory of a bouncing ball by plotting the position of the ball over time. To find the positions we used the equations of motion and the coefficient of restitution. We also observed how the coefficient of restitution impacts the total distance the ball travels (after 10 bounce cycles) by comparing the distance traveled in n bounces with different 
coefficients.

This project was an assignment I completed for my computational physics class (PHYS 305). I enjoyed this assignment specifically because it combined the fundamental equations of motion that I learned in my early physics courses with computer graphics.
